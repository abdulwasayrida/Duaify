# Duaify
Empower yourself through the beauty of duas. 

## Inspiration
Over the past year, the world has faced many challenges. The sudden appearance of COVID-19 impacted millions of lives, leaving people scarred physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Amidst this global pandemic, people were suddenly cut off from their regular religious activities and left isolated, causing many to face a spiritual crisis. 

Duaify aims to alleviate the stress caused by this and help its users fortify their connection to Allah (SWT) and their religion through one of the many beautiful forms of worship - duas.   

## What does Duaify do
Duaify is equipped with many features to assist users of all ages, backgrounds, and circumstances in finding and reinforcing that connection with Islam and Allah (SWT) that may have weakened. Some of the features include but are not limited to:

- Duas for every morning/evening, forgiveness, healing, guidance, and protection
- Tasbeeh counter for Dhikr
- Duas for physical, mental, and spiritual health along with information on Islamic treatment methods for 
   those who may be struggling
- Duas for every day of the week
- Quran, Adhan, Nasheeds, Ruqyah Shariah, Istikhara, and more!

## How we built it
We built the app using Swift + Storyboard (Xcode). We also downloaded and imported the youtube-ios-player-helper CocoaPods to stream high-quality videos of Quran recitations, Adhans, Nasheeds, etc.  

## Challenges we ran into
Since this was our first time developing an app, we had to learn from scratch how to implement certain features such as embedding PDFs, playing YouTube videos, and connecting multiple view controllers, tap bar items, buttons, and Swift classes. 

## What's next for Duaify
In the future, we plan on creating a database for our duas and videos to improve our app's runtime and enhance user experience, along with improvements to our UI and graphics. We also intend to customize the app so it can support more iPhone models (currently Duaify only supports iPhone 11). 

InshaAllah, if all goes well, we may also implement more features and potentially publish Duaify!
